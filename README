Collection of snippets and pieces of code that I use frequently in different 
Django Projects.

Currently unstable -- future versions will break up the geography functions from
the rest, and involve branches with proper versioning. It's in the plan just not
in place, was about to delete the repo after not using for a few months but came
back found it's place in my boilerplate again.
